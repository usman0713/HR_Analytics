HR Analytics Dashboard – Project Overview

📌 Objective

The objective of this HR Analytics Dashboard is to help an organization improve employee performance and enhance employee retention by identifying key factors contributing to attrition. By leveraging data-driven insights, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce trends, enabling HR teams to make informed decisions to reduce attrition and boost employee engagement.


🔄 Data Processing (ETL: Extract, Transform, Load)

Data Extraction: Importing employee data from CSV files into Power BI.
Data Transformation: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by:
Removing duplicates
Handling missing values
Correcting data types
Replacing inconsistent values
Data Loading: Structuring the cleaned data into Power BI for visualization and analysis.


📊 Dashboard Design & Key Components

🔹 Filters & Slicers
Department-based filtering for focused analysis
Gender-based slicer (Male/Female)
🔹 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs were carefully selected using Excel Pivot Tables before implementing them in Power BI:
